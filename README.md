# Cake.ServiceOrchestration

A prototype framework and Cake addin designed to demonstrate orchestrating multi-instance service deployments using Cake scripting.

You can find documentation [here on GitHub](https://agc93.github.io/Cake.ServiceOrchestration).

## Versioning and status

This is an extremely alpha project still in active development. This means that in the pre-1.0 releases, each minor release (e.g. 0.2 to 0.3) is likely to introduce breaking changes as new features are added to the framework. Please pin your versions before deploying any critical workloads.

Check the [Release notes](ReleaseNotes.md) for a summary of changes in each version. Once (if) we reach 1.0, full SemVer will be respected again. 

> Make sure to only use 0.2 or later. The 0.1.x release included a bug in the per-instance path handling that was resolved with a breaking change in 0.2.
